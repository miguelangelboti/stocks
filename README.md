# Stocks
This is an experimental app that allows you to get a list of your stock orders and track your profitability.

This project has been created to improve knowledge about **Android Architecture Component**.
- Uses [Viewodel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) to store UI-related data and survive configuration changes, like app rotations.
- Uses [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) to build data objects that notify views when the underlying data changes.
- Uses [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) as SQLite database management.
